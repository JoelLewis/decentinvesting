## What this is

Decent Investing is an educational guide that walks you through the basics of personal finance and investing in plain language. It covers the steps most people need to build a solid foundation: saving an emergency fund, tackling debt, choosing the right accounts, picking simple investments, and staying the course.

The word "decent" is intentional — this isn't about beating the market or getting rich quick. It's about doing the sensible thing that works for most people, most of the time.
