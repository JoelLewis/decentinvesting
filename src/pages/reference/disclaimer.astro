    <h2>Not Professional Advice</h2>
    <p>
      The content provided on this website is for <strong>informational and educational purposes only</strong>
      and should not be construed as professional financial, investment, tax, or legal advice. The author
      is not acting as a licensed financial advisor, registered investment advisor, or tax professional.
    </p>

    <h2>No Fiduciary Relationship</h2>
    <p>
      Reading or using this information does not establish a professional-client or fiduciary relationship.
      The strategies discussed may not be suitable for your specific financial situation, risk tolerance, or goals.
    </p>

    <h2>Risk Warning</h2>
    <p>
      Investing involves risk, including the <strong>potential loss of principal</strong>. Past performance
      of any security or strategy is not a guarantee of future results. Financial markets are volatile and
      subject to fluctuation.
    </p>

    <h2>Accuracy and Currency</h2>
    <p>
      While every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information at the time of writing,
      tax laws, investment regulations, contribution limits, and market conditions change frequently.
    </p>
    <p>Specific dollar figures (contribution limits, income thresholds) are noted with the year they apply to. <strong>Always verify current-year numbers</strong> at authoritative sources:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IRS contribution limits: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-contributions">irs.gov</a></li>
      <li>Roth IRA income limits: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/roth-iras">irs.gov</a></li>
      <li>HSA limits: <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p969">irs.gov</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fund References</h2>
    <p>
      References to specific investment products (VT, VTI, VXUS, BND, target date funds) are used as
      <strong>examples, not recommendations</strong>. Comparable low-cost index funds are available from
      multiple providers including Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, and others. The author has no financial
      relationship with any fund provider mentioned.
    </p>

    <h2>Consult a Professional</h2>
    <p>
      You should consult with a qualified professional financial advisor, tax accountant, or attorney
      before making any significant financial decisions. Look for a
      <a href="https://www.napfa.org/">fee-only fiduciary</a> to ensure your advisor is legally required
      to act in your best interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>You are solely responsible for your own financial decisions and the consequences thereof.</strong>
