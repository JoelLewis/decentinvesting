# Before You Start

Before opening a single account or buying a single fund, answer one question: **what do you actually want your money to do for you?**

Not in vague terms ("be rich," "retire early") — in specific ones. What does a great ordinary Tuesday look like for you? Where do you live? What do you spend on without thinking? What have you stopped worrying about?

The specifics matter because they determine *which* financial decisions actually move the needle for your life, and which are noise.

## Focus on What Actually Matters

Not all financial decisions are created equal. Some are worth thousands of dollars per year. Most are worth almost nothing.

**High-impact decisions (<NumberHighlight client:load value={30000} prefix="$" /> + lifetime impact):**
- Your savings rate (what percentage of income you keep)
- Capturing your employer's 401k match (free money)
- Your investment fees (a 0.7% difference costs <NumberHighlight client:load value={160000} prefix="$" /> + over 30 years)
- Paying off high-interest debt
- Choosing the right account types (Roth vs Traditional, HSA)

**Low-impact decisions ($3 or less per day):**
- Whether you buy coffee out
- Which streaming services you subscribe to
- Generic vs name brand groceries

Both categories might feel like "being responsible with money," but one group literally determines whether you can retire, and the other determines whether you have an extra $1,000/year. Focus on the big levers first.

## The 85% Solution

The biggest risk in personal finance isn't picking the wrong fund or missing a tax optimization. It's **never starting at all.**

Analysis paralysis is real. People spend months researching the "best" investment account, the "optimal" asset allocation, the "perfect" time to enter the market — and in the meantime, their money sits in a checking account earning nothing.

A good plan you actually follow will dramatically outperform a perfect plan you never start:

- **An 85% optimal portfolio, started today**, beats a 100% optimal portfolio started "eventually"
- The difference between a good index fund and the best index fund is tiny compared to the difference between investing and not investing
- Automating a decent plan removes willpower from the equation entirely

<Callout type="tip" title="Action beats optimization">
If you read this entire guide and do nothing else: open an investment account, set up a monthly automatic transfer of any amount, and buy a target date fund. You can optimize later. The most important step is the first one.

## Automate Everything

Willpower is a terrible financial strategy. The most reliable way to build wealth is to remove yourself from the process entirely.

**Set it up once, then forget it:**

1. **Paycheck → 401k contribution** — deducted before you see the money
2. **Paycheck → checking account** — what's left covers your bills and spending
3. **Checking → IRA / brokerage** — automatic monthly transfer, a few days after payday
4. **Checking → savings** — automatic transfer for your cash cushion

When saving and investing happen automatically, you don't have to make a decision every month. You don't have to feel motivated. The money just moves. This is called [behavioral architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_architecture) — designing your environment so the right choice is the default.

## Name Your Relationship With Money

Everyone has a default pattern with money. Recognizing yours helps you anticipate where you'll get stuck:

- **The Avoider** — doesn't open statements, delegates everything, finds money conversations stressful. *Your risk: inaction. Start small and automate aggressively.*

- **The Optimizer** — tracks every penny, researches endlessly, struggles to spend on things that bring joy. *Your risk: paralysis and under-living. Set a "guilt-free spending" budget and use it.*

- **The Worrier** — anxious about money even when finances are solid, catastrophizes normal market drops. *Your risk: panic selling. Write down your plan and tape it to your monitor.*

- **The Dreamer** — big plans, believes it'll work out, but rarely follows through on the boring steps. *Your risk: all talk, no automation. Set up automatic transfers this week.*

None of these are broken. But they each create a different trap. Knowing which one is yours lets you build guardrails around it instead of pretending it doesn't exist.

## Savings Rate: The Number That Matters Most

Your **savings rate** — the percentage of your gross income that goes toward building wealth (retirement contributions, debt payoff above minimums, investment contributions) — is the single most powerful lever you have.

A rough benchmark: **aim for at least 15% of gross income**, including any employer match. If you can't start there, start wherever you can and increase by 1% every time you get a raise.

| Savings rate | What it means |
|---|---|
| 5-10% | Better than nothing, but you'll work a long time |
| 15% | Solid baseline for a standard retirement |
| 20-25% | Ahead of schedule, more flexibility |
| 30%+ | Early financial independence territory |

The exact number matters less than the direction. Going from 0% to 10% is life-changing. Going from 10% to 15% is great. Going from 15% to 15.3% is a rounding error. Focus on the big jumps.

<Callout type="warning">
- **Waiting for the "right time" to start** — there is no right time. Start now, with whatever you can.
- **Optimizing tiny expenses while ignoring big ones** — cutting $5/day in coffee saves $1,825/year. Negotiating your salary up $5,000 saves $5,000/year *forever* (compounding with future raises).
- **Not capturing your employer match** — this is a guaranteed 50-100% return. Nothing else comes close.
- **Trying to learn everything before doing anything** — you'll learn more by starting than by reading.
