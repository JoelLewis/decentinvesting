# Tackle Debt

Not all debt is created equal. A 3% mortgage on an appreciating house is fundamentally different from a 24% credit card balance. Before you invest aggressively, you need to deal with the expensive stuff.

**The simple rule:** if the interest rate on your debt is higher than what you'd reasonably expect to earn by investing (~7-8% average annual stock market return), pay it off first. That's a guaranteed return.

## Good Debt vs Expensive Debt

| Type                   | Typical rate | Tax deductible? | Example                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Low-cost / "good" debt | 2-6%         | Often yes       | Mortgage, federal student loans            |
| Medium-cost debt       | 6-10%        | Sometimes       | Private student loans, some auto loans     |
| Expensive / "bad" debt | 10-30%+      | No              | Credit cards, payday loans, personal loans |

**Expensive debt is a financial emergency.** A credit card at 24% APR means every $1,000 you carry costs you $240/year in interest. No investment reliably returns 24%. Paying off that card _is_ the best investment you can make.

## The Order: Emergency Fund First

Before you throw every spare dollar at debt:

1. **Build Tier 1 of your emergency fund first** — at least 1 month of expenses in checking.
2. **Keep making minimum payments on everything** — never miss a minimum payment.
3. **Then attack the debt** — with any money above minimums, use one of the strategies below.

## Two Strategies: Avalanche vs Snowball

There are two well-known approaches to paying off multiple debts. Both work. The "best" one is whichever you'll actually stick with.

### Avalanche Method (Lowest Total Cost)

Pay minimums on everything, then put all extra money toward the debt with the **highest interest rate**. When that's paid off, roll the payment to the next highest rate.

**Best for:** People who are motivated by math and logic.

### Snowball Method (Fastest Wins)

Pay minimums on everything, then put all extra money toward the debt with the **smallest balance**. When that's paid off, roll the payment to the next smallest balance.

**Best for:** People who need visible progress to stay motivated.

## When to Pay Debt vs Invest

| Debt interest rate | What to do                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Above 8%**       | Pay it off before investing (beyond employer match)                          |
| **5-8%**           | Judgment call — consider splitting extra money 50/50                         |
| **Below 5%**       | Generally fine to invest while making payments, especially if tax-deductible |

**Always capture your employer 401k match first**, regardless of debt. An employer match is a guaranteed 50-100% instant return — no debt costs that much.

<Callout type="tip" title="The hybrid approach">
  If you have debt in the 5-8% gray zone and can't decide, split your extra money: half toward the
  debt, half toward investing. This is "good enough" — and good enough beats indecision.

## Your Debt-to-Income Ratio

Lenders use your **debt-to-income (DTI) ratio** to determine how much you can borrow:

**DTI = Total monthly debt payments ÷ Gross monthly income**

| DTI       | What it means                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Under 20% | Comfortable — plenty of room                               |
| 20-36%    | Manageable, but watch it                                   |
| 36-43%    | Stretching — hard to qualify for best mortgage rates       |
| Above 43% | Risky — most conventional lenders won't approve a mortgage |

<Callout type="warning">
  - **Ignoring employer match to pay off low-rate debt** — a 50% match on your 401k beats paying off
  a 5% loan every time. - **Consolidating debt into a longer term** — a lower monthly payment at a
  lower rate but over 10 more years can mean *more* total interest paid. Always compare total cost,
  not just the monthly number. - **Paying off the mortgage early when you have credit card debt** —
  always attack the highest rate first. - **Using home equity to pay off credit cards, then running
  up the cards again** — you've converted unsecured debt to secured debt and didn't fix the spending
  pattern. - **Not making a plan** — "I'll pay extra when I can" leads to inconsistent payments.
  Pick a method, set a specific monthly amount, and automate it.
