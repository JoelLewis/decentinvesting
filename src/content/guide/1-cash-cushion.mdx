# Build Your Cash Cushion

Before you invest a single dollar, you need cash you can access on short notice — enough to cover a job loss, a medical bill, or a major car repair without selling investments at a loss or going into debt.

This isn't an investment. It's insurance. The goal isn't growth — it's **preventing a bad surprise from becoming a financial crisis.**

## Figure Out Your Number

Start by calculating your **essential monthly expenses** — the non-negotiable costs you'd still pay if you lost your income tomorrow:

- Housing (rent/mortgage, property tax, insurance)
- Food (groceries, not restaurants)
- Utilities (electric, water, internet, phone)
- Insurance (health, auto)
- Transportation (car payment, gas, transit pass)
- Minimum debt payments
- Healthcare (prescriptions, recurring costs)

Add these up. This is your monthly baseline — the minimum you need to survive. Leave out discretionary spending like dining out, entertainment, and shopping. You'd cut those in a real emergency.

### How Many Months?

Not everyone needs the same cushion. Your target depends on how predictable your income is and how quickly you could replace it:

| Your situation | Target | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Dual income, both stable jobs | 3 months | Low probability both lose income at once |
| Single income, stable job | 6 months | Standard safety net |
| Variable income or freelance | 6-12 months | Income gaps are part of the model |
| Single earner with dependents | 6-12 months | More people depending on one paycheck |
| Nearing retirement | 12+ months | Harder to replace income, more at stake |

## Where to Keep It: The Tiered Approach

Don't dump your entire emergency fund into a single account. Different parts of the fund serve different purposes, and structuring them in tiers lets you balance **instant access** against **earning a reasonable return.**

### Tier 1: Checking Account (1 month of expenses)

Keep roughly one month of essential expenses in your regular checking account as a buffer above your normal spending. This covers small surprises without needing to transfer anything.

- **Access:** Immediate
- **Yield:** ~0.01% (essentially nothing)
- **Purpose:** Day-to-day buffer, small unexpected costs

### Tier 2: High-Yield Savings Account (2-5 months)

The core of your emergency fund. A [High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account#High_yield_savings_accounts) at an online bank typically pays 20-50x more interest than a traditional savings account.

- **Access:** 1-2 business days via transfer
- **Yield:** ~4-5% APY (as of early 2025 — rates change with the fed funds rate)
- **Purpose:** Core emergency fund, accessible within days

### Tier 3: Treasury Bills or CDs (remaining months)

For the portion of your fund you're unlikely to need on short notice, short-term [Treasury bills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security#Treasury_bill) (4-26 week) or [Certificates of Deposit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_deposit) can earn slightly more than a HYSA while remaining very safe.

- **Access:** Days to weeks (T-bills can be sold on secondary market; CDs have early withdrawal penalties)
- **Yield:** ~4.5-5%+ depending on term
- **Purpose:** Extended reserves, unlikely to tap first

### Try It: Build Your Tiered Fund

<Disclosure client:load title="Worked example: $27,000 tiered emergency fund">
Using $4,500/month essential expenses and 6 months of coverage:

| Tier | Amount | Where | Yield |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | $4,500 (1 month) | Checking account | 0.01% |
| Tier 2 | $13,500 (3 months) | HYSA | 4.5% |
| Tier 3 | $9,000 (2 months) | T-bills / CDs | 5.0% |

**Blended yield: ~3.85%** — earning roughly $1,040/year instead of $2.70/year if it all sat in checking.

The tiers are approximate. The exact split matters less than the principle: keep enough immediately accessible, and let the rest work slightly harder.

## What Is (and Isn't) an Emergency

This money is **insurance**, not a savings account for wants. Before you tap it, ask: *is this unexpected, necessary, and urgent?*

**Emergencies:**
- Job loss or significant income reduction
- Medical emergency or unexpected health costs
- Essential car or home repair (your furnace dies in January)
- Emergency travel (family crisis)

**Not emergencies:**
- A vacation deal that's "too good to pass up"
- A new phone because yours is slow
- Holiday gifts (these are predictable — budget for them)
- An investment opportunity (never borrow from your safety net to speculate)

## After You Use It: The Replenishment Plan

If you dip into your emergency fund, **pause non-essential financial goals** and rebuild it before resuming aggressive investing or extra debt payoff.

1. Keep making minimum debt payments and capturing any employer 401k match
2. Redirect other savings and investment contributions toward rebuilding the fund
3. Once you're back to your target, resume your normal plan

Don't beat yourself up for using the fund. That's exactly what it's there for. The only mistake is not refilling it.

<Callout type="warning">
- **Keeping everything in checking at 0.01%** — you're losing ~$1,000+/year in interest on a $27K fund for no reason.
- **Investing the emergency fund in stocks** — a market crash is often *the same time* you lose your job. Your emergency fund needs to be there when everything else is down.
- **"I'll just use a credit card"** — credit lines can be reduced or revoked at the worst possible time, and 20%+ APR turns a $5,000 emergency into a $6,000+ debt spiral.
- **Keeping too much cash** — beyond your target, excess cash has a real cost. Move the excess into investments.
- **Not adjusting for life changes** — got married? Had a kid? Went freelance? Recalculate.
