# Staying the Course

Everything up to this point — building a cash cushion, paying off debt, picking the right accounts and low-cost funds — is the easy part. The hard part is **not doing something stupid when the market drops 30%.**

This page is about the behavioral side of investing. It might be the most important page in this guide.

## Market Drops Are Normal

The stock market doesn't go up in a straight line. It has always experienced regular, significant drops — and it has always recovered.

| Drop size            | How often (roughly)     | Historical examples                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **10%+ correction**  | Every 1-2 years         | Happens so often it barely makes the news          |
| **20%+ bear market** | Every 4-6 years         | COVID crash (2020), trade war (2018)               |
| **30%+ severe bear** | Every 8-12 years        | Financial crisis (2008-09), dot-com bust (2000-02) |
| **50%+ crash**       | A few times per century | Great Depression, 2008-09 at its worst             |

These drops are the **price of admission** for long-term stock market returns.

## What to Do During a Downturn

1. **Nothing.** Do not sell. Do not "move to cash." Do not "wait until things settle down."
2. **Keep contributing.** A downturn means you're buying at lower prices. This is good.
3. **Lean on your cash cushion.** If you lose your job or have an unexpected expense during a downturn, that's exactly what your [emergency fund](/guide/1-cash-cushion) is for. It covers your expenses so you never have to sell investments at the worst possible time.
4. **Don't look at your portfolio.** Check it once a quarter at most.
5. **Reread this page.** You wrote (or read) a plan when you were thinking clearly. Trust the plan.

<Callout type="tip" title="This is why the cash cushion comes first">
  Step 1 of this guide is building a cash cushion *before* you invest. This isn't just about
  financial safety — it's about psychological safety. When the market drops 30% and the headlines
  are screaming, knowing you have 3-6 months of expenses in accessible cash means you can afford to
  do nothing. You don't need to sell stocks to pay rent. You don't need to "lock in" losses because
  of a surprise car repair. Your emergency fund buys you the most valuable thing in investing: the
  ability to wait.

<Disclosure client:load title="The math of panic selling">
Imagine you invest $10,000. The market drops 30% — your portfolio is now $7,000. You panic and sell.

Three months later, the market bounces back 20%. If you'd stayed invested, your $7,000 would be $8,400 — on its way to recovery.

But you sold at $7,000 and put it in savings. The market keeps rising. You wait for a dip. The dip doesn't come. Eventually you reinvest at $9,500. You turned a temporary 30% drop into a permanent 5% loss — plus all the gains you missed.

This is the most common way individual investors destroy their own returns.

## The Biases Working Against You

Your brain is wired for survival, not investing. Several deeply ingrained cognitive biases make it _feel_ rational to do exactly the wrong thing:

### Loss Aversion

Losing $1,000 feels about **twice as painful** as gaining $1,000 feels good. This pain drives you to sell to make the pain stop — even though selling locks in the loss permanently.

### Recency Bias

Whatever happened recently feels like what will keep happening. After a crash, it feels like the market will keep falling forever. After a bull run, it feels like stocks only go up. Neither is true.

### Herding

When everyone around you is selling, it feels irresponsible _not_ to sell. The crowd is usually most enthusiastic at exactly the wrong time (market peaks) and most fearful at exactly the wrong time (market bottoms).

### Overconfidence

After a few good years, it's easy to believe you have a talent for timing markets. Professional fund managers with teams of analysts fail to beat a simple index fund 85-90% of the time. Humility is a genuine edge.

## Behavioral Safeguards

Knowing about biases isn't enough — you need systems:

1. **Write down your investment plan.** Include your target allocation and what you'll do during a downturn (nothing). Tape it somewhere visible.
2. **Automate your contributions.** Money that moves automatically never passes through your hands.
3. **Set a 48-72 hour cooling-off rule.** If you feel a strong urge to change your portfolio, write it down and wait 3 days.
4. **Limit how often you check.** Once a quarter is plenty. Daily checking is harmful.
5. **Have an accountability partner.** An outside perspective during emotional moments is invaluable.

## A Longer View

Since 1928, the U.S. stock market has delivered roughly **10% average annual returns** (~7% after inflation). This includes the Great Depression, World War II, multiple recessions, the dot-com crash, the financial crisis, and a global pandemic.

An investor who put $10,000 into a broad U.S. stock index in 1990 and simply held it — through every crisis — would have roughly **$220,000** by 2024. Not by being clever. Just by not selling.

The returns are there for anyone willing to endure the drops. The market rewards patience and punishes impatience.

<Callout type="warning">
  - **Selling during a downturn** — the #1 destroyer of individual investor returns. - **"Moving to
  cash until things settle down"** — the market's best days often happen right after its worst days.
  Missing just the 10 best days in a 20-year period can cut your returns in half. - **Listening to
  market predictions** — nobody can consistently predict what the market will do short-term. -
  **Confusing a long-term strategy with a short-term bet** — if your timeline is 20+ years, a bad
  year is irrelevant. - **Comparing your returns to others** — your neighbor's crypto gains are not
  relevant to your plan. - **Not having a plan at all** — the worst time to decide your strategy is
  when the market is in free fall.
