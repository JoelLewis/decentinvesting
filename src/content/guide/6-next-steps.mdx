# Next Steps

You've read the guide. Now here's what to actually _do_ — in order, this week if possible.

## The Checklist

### This week (30-60 minutes total)

- **Calculate your essential monthly expenses** — add up housing, food, utilities, insurance, transportation, minimum debt payments, healthcare. ([Cash Cushion](/guide/1-cash-cushion))

- **Open a high-yield savings account** if you don't have one — takes 10 minutes at an online bank. ([Cash Cushion](/guide/1-cash-cushion))

- **Check your 401k contribution rate** — are you contributing enough to get the full employer match? ([Accounts](/guide/3-investment-accounts))

- **Set up one automatic transfer** — from checking to savings or investment account. Any amount. ([Before You Start](/guide/0-before-you-start))

### This month

- **List all your debts** with balances and interest rates. If anything is above 8%, make a payoff plan. ([Tackle Debt](/guide/2-tackle-debt))

- **Open a Roth IRA** (if eligible) at a low-cost brokerage. Set up automatic monthly contributions. ([Accounts](/guide/3-investment-accounts))

- **Pick a simple investment** — a target date fund or a low-cost index fund. ([Investment Choices](/guide/4-investment-choices))

- **Check your HSA eligibility** — if you have a high-deductible health plan, you might be leaving triple-tax-advantage money on the table. ([Accounts](/guide/3-investment-accounts))

### This quarter

- **Name or update your beneficiaries** on every account (see below).

- **Write a one-page investment plan** — your target allocation, what you'll invest in, and what you'll do during a downturn (nothing). ([Staying the Course](/guide/5-staying-the-course))

- **Review your expense ratios** — check every fund in your 401k and IRA. ([Investment Choices](/guide/4-investment-choices))

### Once a year

- **Review your allocation** — rebalance if needed.
- **Increase your savings rate** — by 1% every year, or by half of any raise.
- **Review your emergency fund target** — has your spending changed?
- **Verify contribution limits** — [irs.gov](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-contributions)

## Name Your Beneficiaries

This is a **5-minute task** with enormous consequences. Beneficiary designations on retirement accounts and life insurance policies **override your will.** If your beneficiaries are out of date, the money goes to whoever is listed — even an ex-spouse, even a deceased relative's estate.

**Action items:**

1. Log into each retirement account and life insurance policy
2. Check who is listed as primary and contingent beneficiary
3. Update if needed (after marriage, divorce, birth of a child, death of a beneficiary)
4. Set a calendar reminder to review annually

## When to Get Professional Help

Some situations genuinely benefit from professional advice:

**Consider a professional if you:**

- Have a complex tax situation (business ownership, stock options, real estate)
- Are going through a major life change (inheritance, divorce, early retirement)
- Have a high net worth and want tax optimization beyond the basics
- Feel overwhelmed and want someone to build a plan with you

**If you do hire someone, look for:**

- A **[fiduciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary)** — legally required to act in your interest
- **Fee-only** — paid by you, not by commissions
- **CFP (Certified Financial Planner)** credential

<Callout type="warning" title="Red flags in a financial advisor">
  - They earn commissions on the products they recommend - They won't clearly explain their fee
  structure - They push complex products (annuities, whole life insurance) before you've maxed out
  simple options - They guarantee specific returns - They don't ask about your goals, timeline, and
  risk tolerance before recommending investments

## Keep Learning

The most important thing you can do is **take the first step this week** — open an account, set up an automatic transfer, buy a target date fund. The details can be refined over time. The action can't wait.
