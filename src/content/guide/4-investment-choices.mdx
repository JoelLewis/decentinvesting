# Simple Investment Choices

You've built your cash cushion, handled expensive debt, and opened the right accounts. Now: what do you actually *buy* inside those accounts?

The answer is simpler than the financial industry wants you to believe.

## The Core Idea: Index Funds

An [index fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund) is a fund that owns a little bit of everything in a market index. Instead of trying to pick winning stocks, you just own the whole market.

**Why this works:**
- Over any 20-year period in history, the broad stock market has produced positive returns
- 85-90% of professional fund managers **fail to beat** a simple index fund after fees over 10+ years
- You don't need to research individual companies, time the market, or make trading decisions

## Fees: The Silent Wealth Destroyer

Every fund charges an **expense ratio (ER)** — an annual percentage fee deducted from your returns. The difference between a cheap fund and an expensive one is enormous over time.

| Fund type | Typical expense ratio |
|---|---|
| Broad index fund (VTI, VXUS, BND) | 0.03-0.10% |
| Target date index fund | 0.10-0.15% |
| Actively managed fund | 0.50-1.50%+ |

**The rule:** target expense ratios below **0.20%** for stock funds and below **0.10%** for bond funds.

## ETF vs Mutual Fund

| | ETF | Index Mutual Fund |
|---|---|---|
| **How you buy** | Like a stock — any time during market hours | Once per day at closing price |
| **Minimum investment** | Price of 1 share (often $50-400) | Often $1,000-$3,000 |
| **Tax efficiency** | Slightly better (in taxable accounts) | Slightly worse |
| **Automatic investing** | Harder to automate | Easy recurring purchases |

**Bottom line:** The differences are minor. Don't let this decision slow you down.

## Why International Diversification Matters

The U.S. stock market represents roughly **60%** of the total world stock market. Investing *only* in U.S. stocks means you're betting the U.S. will always outperform. Sometimes it does (2010-2024). Sometimes it doesn't (2000-2009).

A fund like [**VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF)**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) owns the whole world in a single purchase: ~60% U.S., ~40% international. Expense ratio: 0.07%.

## The Missing Piece: Bonds

Total stock market funds are **100% equities**. For many investors — especially those within 10-15 years of needing the money — that's too aggressive.

[Bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)) are loans you make to governments or corporations. They pay interest and are generally less volatile than stocks.

A common rule of thumb: **your bond allocation ≈ your age minus 20** (so a 40-year-old holds ~20% bonds).

### Build Your Allocation

## Simple Portfolio Options

From simplest to slightly more hands-on:

### Option 1: Target Date Fund (Simplest)

A single fund that automatically adjusts as you age. Pick the fund closest to your expected retirement year.

- **Example:** [Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vttsx) — ~0.08% ER
- **You do:** Buy it and contribute regularly. That's it.

This is the **85% Solution** in its purest form.

### Option 2: One-Fund Global Equity (VT)

All-stock, all-world: **VT** — 0.07% ER. Simple if you're young and decades from retirement.

### Option 3: Two-Fund (VT + BND)

Global stocks plus bonds in whatever ratio matches your age: **VT** + **BND** (0.03% ER).

### Option 4: Three-Fund Portfolio

The classic [Bogleheads three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio): **VTI** (0.03%) + **VXUS** (0.07%) + **BND** (0.03%).

<Callout type="tip" title="Which option should you pick?">
If you're just starting and feeling overwhelmed: **Target Date Fund.** It's genuinely good enough for an entire career of investing.

If you already have a basic understanding and want simplicity with slightly lower fees: **VT + BND.**

The difference between these options over a lifetime is small. The difference between *any* of them and not investing is enormous.

<Disclosure client:load title="Rebalancing basics">
If you hold multiple funds, your portfolio drifts over time. **Rebalancing** means returning to your target allocation.

**When to rebalance:**
- **Simple approach:** Once or twice a year
- **Threshold approach:** When any asset class drifts more than 5 percentage points from target

**Tax-smart rebalancing:**
- In tax-advantaged accounts: rebalance freely — no tax consequences
- In taxable accounts: direct *new contributions* to the underweight asset

Target date funds rebalance automatically. This is one of their key advantages.

<Callout type="warning">
- **Paying high fees without realizing it** — check the expense ratio of every fund you own. If anything is above 0.50%, investigate cheaper alternatives.
- **Holding zero bonds at age 55** — 100% stocks is valid at 25, not at 55.
- **Only investing in U.S. stocks** — home country bias is natural but costly. Own the world.
- **Constantly checking your portfolio** — investors who check daily make worse decisions than those who check quarterly.
- **Trying to time the market** — time in the market beats timing the market.
- **Buying individual stocks with core retirement savings** — fine as 5-10% play money, not for your core portfolio.
