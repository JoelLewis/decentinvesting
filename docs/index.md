# Decent Investing

**Simple steps to help most people start and stay safe.**



> **Disclaimer:** These notes cover the basics to build a strong financial foundation. They work for many, but not all. If you have significant debt, large dependents, or a unique tax situation (e.g., business owner), you likely need a specific plan. Consult a lawyer, accountant, or registered financial advisor.



**The Strategy:**

1. **Build your cash cushion:** Emergency Funds and Basic Savings.

2. **Prioritize your accounts:** Employer Matches, HSAs, IRAs, and 401ks.

3. **Simplify investment choices:** Diversified index ETFs and Target Date Funds.

   

## 1. Build Your Cash Cushion

Analyze your checking accounts and credit cards to determine your typical monthly spend—a 12-month average is ideal. Once you have that number, **multiply it by 3 to 9**.

This is your target savings number. On one day's notice, you should be able to move this cash to your checking account to pay for a surprise expense—a flat tire, a medical emergency, or a layoff—without selling long-term investments at a loss.

Keep this cash in a [High Yield Savings Account (HYSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account#High_yield_savings_accounts) or a [Money Market Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market_fund). This allows you to earn interest and keep up with [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation). The goal isn't to aggressively grow this cash; the goal is to prevent its [purchasing power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power) from shrinking while it sits there waiting for an emergency.

## 2. Which Investment Accounts to Use First

There are two main buckets of investment accounts: **Standard** and **Tax-Advantaged**.

### The Basic: Taxable Brokerage Account

Often called a "brokerage account" or "investment account," this is the standard account most people should have. You put money in, buy investments (stocks, bonds, funds), and pay taxes on any gains in the year they are realized (when you sell for a profit or receive a dividend).

- **Joint Account:** Two people own it together.
- **Trust Account:** Owned by a trust for beneficiaries.

### The Advanced: Tax-Advantaged Accounts

These accounts offer tax breaks to encourage saving for specific life events (Retirement, Healthcare, Education).

#### The Hierarchy of Saving

*Generally, you should fill these accounts in this order:*

1. **401k (up to match):** Free money from your employer.
2. **HSA:** Triple tax advantage (if eligible).
3. **IRA:** More investment choices and lower fees than most 401ks.
4. **401k (remaining):** To lower your taxable income.
5. **Taxable Brokerage:** For anything left over.



The biggest exception to this approach is if you have a near term (before retirement) saving or purchase goal( e.g. a vacation, buying a house). Spending for something like that is best done out of the taxable brokerage account, a savings account, or a money market fund in most cases, so you should be saving and investing for goals like that in that account too.

### Account Types and Details

#### 401k (Traditional)

This is an employer-sponsored plan. You contribute pre-tax money, which lowers your taxable income for the year. The money grows tax-deferred. You pay income taxes on the money when you withdraw it in retirement.

- **Key Feature:** High contribution limits and often includes an **Employer Match** (free money).

#### Roth 401k

Some employers offer a "Roth" version of the 401k. You contribute money *after* you have paid taxes on it. The benefit is that the money grows tax-free, and you pay **zero taxes** when you withdraw it in retirement.

- **Best for:** Young earners or those who believe their taxes are lower now than they will be in retirement.

#### Traditional IRA (Individual Retirement Account)

Like the Traditional 401k, you generally don't pay taxes on the money you put in (deductible) or the gains it makes year-over-year. You pay income tax when you withdraw the money.

- **Catch:** If you withdraw early for a "non-qualified" reason, you pay a penalty plus taxes.

#### Roth IRA

You pay taxes on the money *before* you put it in, but it grows tax-free forever. You pay no taxes when you withdraw it in retirement.

- **Flexibility:** You can withdraw your *contributions* (but not your earnings) at any time, penalty-free.
- **Limits:** There are [income caps](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/iras/roth-ira-income-limits) on who can contribute. (High earners may need a "Backdoor Roth" strategy).

#### HSA (Health Savings Account)

The "Triple Tax Threat."

1. Contributions reduce your taxable income.
2. Growth is tax-free.
3. Withdrawals for eligible medical expenses are tax-free.

- **Secret Weapon:** You can invest the funds in the HSA. Many people pay medical bills out of pocket now and let the HSA grow for decades to cover healthcare costs in retirement. [See more](https://www.truemed.com/).

#### FSA (Flexible Spending Account)

Usually for health or dependent care. Contributions reduce your taxable income.

- **The Catch:** "Use it or lose it." Funds generally do not roll over to the next year.

#### 529 Plan

A state-sponsored education savings plan. Contributions grow tax-free for qualified education expenses. Some states offer a state income tax deduction for contributing.

## 3. Simple Investment Choices

Don’t overcomplicate the *investments* inside your accounts.

### Global Diversification

If you want a simple option for funds you are trying to grow for the long term (10+ years), look at a globally diversified mutual fund or ETF like [**VT (Vanguard Total World Stock)**](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt). This buys you a tiny piece of almost every public company on earth.

### Target Date Funds

These funds automatically rebalance based on when you plan to need the money (retirement or college).

- **How they work:** They prioritize high growth (stocks) when the date is far away, and stability (bonds/cash) as you get closer to the date.
- **Example:** [Vanguard's Target Retirement Funds](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/target-retirement-funds).



## Next Steps

This is a simple and basic way to get started - it is not optimal for everyone, it is not customized for your needs. If you have questions, working with a lawyer, accountant, or advisor is the best way to get tailored advice. If you want to learn more, I've learned a lot and been inspired by:
