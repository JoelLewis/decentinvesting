# Contributing to Decent Investing

## Content guidelines

- **Match the tone.** The guide is approachable, honest, and non-condescending. Write like you're explaining something to a friend, not lecturing a student.
- **No jargon without explanation.** If you must use a technical term, explain it in plain language.
- **Cite your sources.** Factual claims — especially about tax rules, contribution limits, or historical returns — should link to authoritative sources.
- **This is education, not advice.** Content should help people understand concepts and make their own informed decisions. Never tell readers what they *should* do with their money.

## Important: the disclaimer

Everything on this site is educational, not advisory. Please keep this in mind when writing or editing content. If something could be read as personal financial advice, reframe it. When in doubt, add a reminder that readers should consult a qualified professional.
